# Day 01 — Largest Element in Array

## Problem
Find the largest element in a given array.

## Approach
Used the accumulator pattern to track the maximum value during a single traversal.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)  since only one traversal
- Space: O(1) since only one variable is used

## Key Learning
Understanding linear traversal and accumulator pattern.
