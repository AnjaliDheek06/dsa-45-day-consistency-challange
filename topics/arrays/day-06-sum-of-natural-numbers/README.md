# Day 06 — Sum of Natural Numbers

## Problem
Find the sum of first N natural numbers.

Example:  Input: 5  
                Output: 15


## Approach
Used an iterative loop from 1 to N and accumulated the total sum using the accumulator pattern.


## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)  since loop runs from 0 to n, because the number of operations grows linearly with n.
- Space Complexity: O(1)  since only one variable sum and loop variable i is used and no extra data structure is used therefore it has constant space



## Key Learning
Practiced loop-based accumulation in C++.
Reinforced understanding of linear time complexity.
