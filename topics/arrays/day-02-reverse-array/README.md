# Day 02 - Reverse an Array

# Problem 
Reverse a given Array

# Approach 
Used two pointer technique to swap elements from both ends.

# Complexity
Time : O(n) because each element is visited at most once due to the two pointer approach
Space : O(n) because no extra space is used than few pointers and variables.And Array is reversed inplace

# Key Learning
Understood inplace reversal and pointer manipulation
