# Day 04 — Average of all elements in Array

## Problem
Average of all the elements in the array .

## Approach
Used for loop traverse through the array and while traversing maintained a variable for storing sum of the elements of the array
After completing the traversal simply divide the sum by no. of elements in the array.
## Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) As we are traversing the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1). No addition space being used.

## Key Learning
Practiced linear traversal of an array.
Understood the accumulator pattern using total_sum to aggregate values.
Learned why division may require float handling when computing averages.
Reinforced the importance of separating logic inside a main() function.
Recognized time complexity of simple array traversal problems.
